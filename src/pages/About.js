        hey hey hey! i'm someone who's a bit all over the place. i love all
        things tech, muesums, roaming downtowns, trying out different cuisines, and so much more.
        sometimes i feel like a sponge, going around and learning as much as i
        can from the amazing people around me üßΩ .

        <br />
        i'm a hobby hopper, i dabble in the tech, i stay fit, and i'm
        currently on the quest for a perfect oatmeal recipe. my existence in so
        many things really helped shape the learner that i am today, and the one
        i'll be tomorrow!
